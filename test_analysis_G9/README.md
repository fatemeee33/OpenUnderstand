# Set & SetBy


### Introduction
This code represents a Python class named `SetAndSetByListener`, which is a custom listener class inheriting from `JavaParserLabeledListener`. This class is designed to traverse through a Java code AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) generated by a parser (`JavaParserLabeled`) and gather information about assignments of values to variables, method calls, and object creations. The purpose of this README is to provide an overview of the functionality and usage of this code.

### Usage
To utilize this code, you need to have the Java source code parsed using a parser capable of generating ASTs compatible with the `JavaParserLabeled` grammar. After parsing the Java code, you can instantiate an object of the `SetAndSetByListener` class by passing the file name of the Java source file as an argument to its constructor. Then, you can traverse the AST using the `JavaParserLabeled` parser and feed it to the `SetAndSetByListener` object.

### Functionality
1. **Tracking Assignments**: The listener tracks assignments of values to variables. It records details such as the name of the variable being assigned (`set_short_name`), the fully qualified name of the variable (`set_long_name`), the file name, line number, column number, package name, and other relevant information.

2. **Tracking Method Calls**: It also tracks method calls, capturing details such as the method name, file name, line number, column number, package name, etc.

3. **Tracking Object Creations**: The listener identifies object creation instances, collecting information like the class name, file name, line number, column number, package name, etc.

4. **Error Handling**: The code includes error handling mechanisms to catch and print any exceptions that might occur during execution.

### Methods
- `add_set_by_entry`: This method adds an entry to the list `setBy`, which contains information about variable assignments, method calls, and object creations.
- `get_parent_node`: This method retrieves the parent node of a given node based on specific rule indices.

### Listener Methods
- `enterClassDeclaration`: Triggered when entering a class declaration.
- `enterMethodDeclaration`: Triggered when entering a method declaration.
- `enterExpression21`: Triggered when entering an expression.
- `exitExpression21`: Triggered when exiting an expression.
- `enterVariableDeclarator`: Triggered when entering a variable declarator.
- `exitVariableDeclarator`: Triggered when exiting a variable declarator.
- `exitPackageDeclaration`: Triggered when exiting a package declaration.
- `exitMethodCall0`: Triggered when exiting a method call.

### Tests
We Tested it on a Project called JSON on benchmark/JSON with code i've provided in Code/Tests.py

# Set Init & SetBy Init


### Introduction
This Python code defines a custom listener class named `SetInitAndSetByInitListener`, which inherits from `JavaParserLabeledListener`. The purpose of this listener is to traverse the AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) generated by a Java parser (`JavaParserLabeled`) and gather information about variable initializations. It tracks the initialization of variables, captures details such as the variable name, type, value, file name, line number, column number, package name, etc., and stores this information in a list named `set_init_by`.

### Usage
To utilize this code, you need to have a Java parser capable of generating ASTs compatible with the `JavaParserLabeled` grammar. After parsing the Java code, you can instantiate an object of the `SetInitAndSetByInitListener` class by passing the file name of the Java source file as an argument to its constructor. Then, you can traverse the AST using the `JavaParserLabeled` parser and feed it to the `SetInitAndSetByInitListener` object.

### Functionality
1. **Tracking Variable Initializations**: The listener tracks variable initialization instances, capturing details such as the variable name, type, value, file name, line number, column number, package name, etc.

2. **Error Handling**: The code includes basic error handling mechanisms to handle exceptions gracefully.

### Methods
- `enterClassDeclaration`: Triggered when entering a class declaration.
- `enterMethodDeclaration`: Triggered when entering a method declaration.
- `enterVariableInitializer1`: Triggered when entering a variable initializer.
- `exitVariableInitializer1`: Triggered when exiting a variable initializer.
- `exitPackageDeclaration`: Triggered when exiting a package declaration.

### Tests
We Tested it on a Project called JSON on OpenUnderstand/benchmark/JSON with code i've provided in Code/Tests.py
#### Entity founded numbers

Here We are compare answers of Open Understand with Scitools Understand in number of entities and Both of them give us 310

# Set Partial & SetBy Partial

### Introduction
This Python code defines a custom listener class named `SetPartialAndSetByPartialListener`, which inherits from `JavaParserLabeledListener`. The purpose of this listener is to traverse the AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) generated by a Java parser (`JavaParserLabeled`) and gather partial information about variable assignments. It specifically focuses on cases where the assignment is done within an expression.

### Usage
To utilize this code, you need to have a Java parser capable of generating ASTs compatible with the `JavaParserLabeled` grammar. After parsing the Java code, you can instantiate an object of the `SetPartialAndSetByPartialListener` class by passing the file name of the Java source file as an argument to its constructor. Then, you can traverse the AST using the `JavaParserLabeled` parser and feed it to the `SetPartialAndSetByPartialListener` object.

### Functionality
1. **Tracking Partial Variable Assignments**: The listener tracks partial variable assignments within expressions. It captures details such as the variable name, type, value (if available), file name, line number, column number, package name, etc.

2. **Error Handling**: The code includes basic error handling mechanisms to handle exceptions gracefully.

### Methods
- `add_set_by_entry`: This method adds an entry to the list `set_by_partial`, which contains partial information about variable assignments within expressions.
- `enterClassDeclaration`: Triggered when entering a class declaration.
- `enterMethodDeclaration`: Triggered when entering a method declaration.
- `enterExpression21`: Triggered when entering an expression.
- `exitExpression21`: Triggered when exiting an expression.
- `exitPackageDeclaration`: Triggered when exiting a package declaration.

### Tests
We Tested it on a Project called JSON on benchmark/JSON with code i've provided in Code/Tests.py
